## Component Descriptions

- Omniverse [[link](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/)][[docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/)]
  > The platform for connecting and developing OpenUSD applications.
  >
  > -- [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/)

  It is worth noting that Omniverse is a platform, and is not a standalone application. Therefore, the term `Omniverse`, should not be used to refer to a specific component, but to the entire platform. Technically speaking, there is no such thing as an Omniverse app/component in the entire software stack. For an example, [Omniverse USD Composer](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/composer/latest/index.html) (formerly _Omniverse Create_) and [Omniverse USD Presenter](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/presenter/latest/index.html) (formerly _Omniverse View_) are apps built upon [Omniverse Kit](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/dev-guide/latest/kit-architecture.html). They are software components that run on the Omniverse platform.

  Isaac stands as NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated solution for robotics, which refers to the robotics platform instead of a specific software component. Alongside essential tools for general AI applications (such as TensorRT, TAO Toolkit, and Triton Inference Server), Isaac comprises two primary branches for local execution: Simulation and Deployment. The Simulation branch, including components like Isaac Sim and Isaac Gym, currently requires the use of x86 CPUs and RTX GPUs to accelerated simulations. Conversely, the Deployment branch, featuring components like Isaac ROS, can run on both PC and on Jetson hardware.

  > -- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim)

  Before starting, please make sure your hardware and software meet the [system requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html#system-requirements).

  Technically, Isaac Sim is an app built upon Omniverse Kit, which is a SDK for building apps upon the Omniverse platform. The simulation is accelerated by PhysX, while the scene is rendered through RTX rendering.  

  Isaac Sim can be downloaded through [Omniverse Launcher](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/) here:
  - [Linux](https://install.launcher.omniverse.nvidia.com/installers/omniverse-launcher-linux.AppImage)
  - [Windows](https://install.launcher.omniverse.nvidia.com/installers/omniverse-launcher-win.exe)

  The assets are accessed through [Omniverse Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/index.html), which requires setting up a (local) Nucleus account. In addition, installing [Omniverse Cache](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_utilities/prod_utilities/cache/overview.html) can speed up the access to Nucleus. If no custom assets are used, the built-in assets can be accessed through the default remote Nucleus server.

    The term `Isaac Gym` is ambiguous when viewed from a technical perspective. It's better to specify whether the mentioned Isaac Gym is based on Isaac Sim, or the preview version that does not base on Isaac Sim.

    > Until Omniverse Isaac Gym functionality is feature complete, this standalone Isaac Gym Preview release will remain available.
    >
    > -- [NVIDIA Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym)

    The latest release of Isaac Gym (Preview Release) is Preview 4, and will not be further updated.

- Isaac Orbit [[docs](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/orbit/)][[docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/ext_omni_isaac_orbit.html)][[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04195)][[site](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/)][[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/Orbit)]  
  a general repository based on Isaac Sim that features a number of GPU-accelerated simulation environments, a variety of motion generators, integrations with several reinforcement learning libraries, utilities for imitation learning, etc.  
  Released under the BSD 3-Clause License ([source](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/Orbit/blob/main/LICENSE)).
  > a unified and modular framework for robot learning that aims to simplify common workflows in robotics research (such as RL, learning from demonstrations, and motion planning).
  >
  > -- [NVIDIA Isaac Orbit](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/Orbit)

  Omniverse Isaac Gym is a light-weight framework focusing on reinforcement learning tasks, while Isaac Orbit is a more general and modular framework that focuses on robotics applications. ([source](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/orbit/blob/main/docs/source/setup/faq.rst), [source](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/orbit-vs-omniisaacgymenvs/251329/3))

  Personally, I think Isaac Orbit is preferred for general usages such as creating custom environments. However, if you are writing a research paper and just want to use built-in Omniverse Isaac Gym Environments for benchmarking, Omniverse Isaac Gym may be enough.

- Isaac Robot Operating System (ROS) [[link](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros)][[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS)][[docs](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/index.html)]  
  a collection of GPU-accelerated ROS2 packages (i.e., Isaac GEMs).  
  > a collection of hardware-accelerated packages that make it easier for ROS developers to build high-performance solutions on NVIDIA hardware.
  >
  > -- [Isaac ROS](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros)

  The term `Isaac ROS` refer to the packages for ROS 2, instead of Isaac SDK. Isaac ROS should not be confused with the `ROS & ROS 2 Bridges` in Isaac Sim, or the `ROS Bridge` in Isaac SDK.  
  The packages (i.e., Isaac GEMs) are named as `Isaac ROS <Package_Name>`. Unfortunately, ambiguous terms such as `Isaac Elbrus` still exist ([source](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_visual_slam)). Since the Elbrus package exist in both Isaac ROS and Isaac SDK, Elbrus should be refered to as `Isaac ROS Elbrus` for preciseness.  

  Before starting, please make sure your PC/Jetson hardware and software meet the [system requirements](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/index.html#system-requirements). After checking the requirements, I suggest you start from the Nvblox tutorial below.

  - (Isaac ROS) Nvblox [[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nvblox)]
    > processes depth and pose to reconstruct a 3D scene in real-time and outputs a 2D costmap for Nav2. The costmap is used in planning during navigation as a vision-based solution to avoid obstacles.
    >
    > -- [Isaac ROS Nvblox](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nvblox)

    You can quickly experience the power of Isaac ROS by simply following the [the quick start guide](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/index.html#quickstart) of Nvblox.

    This packages includes the use of the [Isaac ROS Visual SLAM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_visual_slam) package, which uses [cuVSLAM](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/concepts/visual_slam/cuvslam/index.html) as the underlying algorithm.
  - (Isaac ROS) NVIDIA Isaac for Transport for ROS (NITROS) [[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nitros)]
    > the NVIDIA implementation of type adaption and negotiation for ROS2 that eliminates software/CPU overhead and improves performance of hardware acceleration.

    > -- [Isaac ROS](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros) (slightly rephrased)
  - [etc.](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/index.html)

- Isaac SDK [[docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/archive/2021.1/doc/index.html)]  
  a toolkit for deploying GPU-accelerated algorithms on physical robots.
  > a toolkit that includes building blocks and tools that accelerate robot developments that require the increased perception and navigation features enabled by AI.
  >
  > -- [NVIDIA Isaac SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sdk)

  Personally, I suggest using Isaac ROS instead of Isaac SDK for simplicity. Since researchers/engineers working on robotics tend to be more familiar with the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) than the `bazel` command used in Isaac SDK. The Isaac GEMs and Isaac Applications included in Isaac SDK are also available in Isaac ROS.

  > Isaac includes Isaac GEMs for both NVIDIAâ€™s Isaac SDK Engine and ROS2. Isaac ROS has been more recently updated to contribute hardware acceleration to the growing ROS ecosystem. You can choose whichever one is more suitable for your project.

  >
  > -- [NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/perceptor)

  Personally, I think these GPU-accelerated packages would be released as Isaac ROS packages in the future. This means we can expect more versatile and powerful Isaac ROS packages than currently released packages such as [Isaac ROS Nvblox](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/index.html) for navigation tasks.

  Personally, I think Isaac AMR is an extension of Isaac SDK. This is based on the Isaac Sight UI screenshots in [source](https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/doc/extensions/navigation_stack/doc/navigation_stack_on_isaac_sim.html), and I've noticed some Isaac SDK docs have been redirected/moved to Isaac AMR docs.

For questions regarding the Isaac components, I recommend first going through the [Known Issues](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/known_issues.html), then considering asking in the [NVIDIA Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/) under the [Isaac topic](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/isaac-sdk/15).

I have documented some bug fixes and workarounds for Isaac in the [j3soon/isaac-extended](https://github.com/j3soon/isaac-extended) repository. I recommend also checking out that repository for reference.

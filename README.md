  Before starting, please make sure your hardware and software meet the [system requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html#system-requirements).

  Technically, Isaac Sim is an app built upon Omniverse Kit, which is a SDK for building apps upon the Omniverse platform. The simulation is accelerated by PhysX, while the scene is rendered through RTX rendering.  
  Isaac Sim can be downloaded through [Omniverse Launcher](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/) here:
  - [Linux](https://install.launcher.omniverse.nvidia.com/installers/omniverse-launcher-linux.AppImage)
  - [Windows](https://install.launcher.omniverse.nvidia.com/installers/omniverse-launcher-win.exe)

  The required assets are accessed through [Omniverse Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/index.html), which requires setting up a (local) Nucleus account. In addition, installing [Omniverse Cache](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_utilities/prod_utilities/cache/overview.html) can speed up the access to Nucleus.
  - Isaac Sim Unity3D [[docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/archive/2020.1/doc/simulation/unity3d.html)]  
    Unity3D support has been deprecated ([source](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/no-isaac-sim-unity3d-to-download/212951)). The term `Isaac Sim` now refer to the Omniverse-based version.

    The term `Isaac Gym` is ambiguous when viewed from a technical perspective. It's better to specify whether the mentioned Isaac Gym is based on Isaac Sim, or the preview version that does not base on Isaac Sim.

    > Until Omniverse Isaac Gym functionality is feature complete, this standalone Isaac Gym Preview release will remain available.

    The latest release of Isaac Gym (Preview Release) is Preview 4, and will not be further updated.

  Omniverse Isaac Gym is a light-weight framework focusing on reinforcement learning tasks, while Isaac Orbit is a more general and modular framework that focuses on robotics applications. ([source](https://nvidia.slack.com/archives/C01TGK0GSJG/p1675192628308169?thread_ts=1674981564.933639&cid=C01TGK0GSJG))

- Isaac Robot Operating System (ROS) [[link](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros)][[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS)][[docs](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/index.html)]  
  a collection of GPU-accelerated ROS2 packages (i.e., Isaac GEMs).  
  > a collection of hardware-accelerated packages that make it easier for ROS developers to build high-performance solutions on NVIDIA hardware.
  >
  > -- [Isaac ROS](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros)

  The term `Isaac ROS` refer to the packages for ROS 2, instead of Isaac SDK. Isaac ROS should not be confused with the `ROS & ROS 2 Bridges` in Isaac Sim, or the `ROS Bridge` in Isaac SDK.  
  The packages (i.e., Isaac GEMs) are named as `Isaac ROS <Package_Name>`. Unfortunately, ambiguous terms such as `Isaac Elbrus` still exist ([source](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_visual_slam)). Since the Elbrus package exist in both Isaac ROS and Isaac SDK, Elbrus should be refered to as `Isaac ROS Elbrus` for preciseness.  

  Before starting, please make sure your PC/Jetson hardware and software meet the [system requirements](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/index.html#system-requirements). After checking the requirements, I suggest you start from the Nvblox tutorial below.

  - (Isaac ROS) Nvblox [[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nvblox)]
    > processes depth and pose to reconstruct a 3D scene in real-time and outputs a 2D costmap for Nav2. The costmap is used in planning during navigation as a vision-based solution to avoid obstacles.

    > -- [Isaac ROS Nvblox](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nvblox)

    You can quickly experience the power of Isaac ROS by simply following the [the quick start guide](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/index.html#quickstart) of Nvblox.
  - (Isaac ROS) NVIDIA Isaac for Transport for ROS (NITROS) [[github](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nitros)]
    > the NVIDIA implementation of type adaption and negotiation for ROS2 that eliminates software/CPU overhead and improves performance of hardware acceleration.

    > -- [Isaac ROS](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros) (slightly rephrased)
  - [etc.](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/index.html)

- Isaac SDK [[docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/archive/2021.1/doc/index.html)]  
  a toolkit for deploying GPU-accelerated algorithms on physical robots.
  > a toolkit that includes building blocks and tools that accelerate robot developments that require the increased perception and navigation features enabled by AI.
  >
  > -- [NVIDIA Isaac SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sdk)

  Personally, I suggest using Isaac ROS instead of Isaac SDK for simplicity. Since researchers/engineers working on robotics tend to be more familiar with the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) than the `bazel` command used in Isaac SDK. The Isaac GEMs and Isaac Applications included in Isaac SDK are also available in Isaac ROS.

  > Isaac includes Isaac GEMs for both NVIDIAâ€™s Isaac SDK Engine and ROS2. Isaac ROS has been more recently updated to contribute hardware acceleration to the growing ROS ecosystem. You can choose whichever one is more suitable for your project.
